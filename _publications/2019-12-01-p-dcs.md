title: "Polled Digital Cell Sorter (p-DCS): Automatic identification of hematological cell types from single cell RNA-sequencing clusters"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-12-01-p-dcs
excerpt: 'This is work from my undergraduate research. We designed a voting-based algorithm to identify cell types using prior knowledge. I contributed to the algorithm design, specifically implementing a cross-validation scheme to determine the optimal number of clusters in our data.'
